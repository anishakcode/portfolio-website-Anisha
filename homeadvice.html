In addition, they have to deal with the lack of assurance of whether the source is experienced and reliable, will respond within a certain timeframe, or even understand what their problem is. Then there is the issue of secure payment and information security.</p>

                    <h3>User Personas</h3>
                    <p>In order to follow a user-centered design process, I created user personas in order to empathize with the different types of users. These personas are based on the research conducted. These user personas serve as a starting point to reflect on the needs, behaviors,  and challenges of the user and possible solutions that can be considered later throughout the design process.</p>

                    <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
                    <p>After identifying scenarios that each persona would come across, user journey maps were constructed to better understand how users will use the app to complete a specific goal. Each scenario was broken to represent the user’s thought and emotional experiences.  Each step uncovered useful insights that helped to determine which features will be useful for the app.</p>

                    <p>I continued on to the task analysis process to determine what tasks are required to complete a goal in the contest of the personas I created. This involved creating task flows and then adding context and visual aspects in the form of user flows.</p>

                    <p>Using the user journey maps and personas I created, I set out to create the structure of the app, in particular its hierarchy.  I started to plan out the primary and secondary screens and put together a sitemap. I decided the best fit for my app was a strict hierarchy layout structure.</p>

                    <h3>Card Sort</h3>
                    <p>I have created a solid plan for the organization of the information of my application, but I must make sure that my plan is intuitive in the eyes of the user.  To ensure this I used a participatory design method, card sorting, to provide me with insights on how to create the most logical and user-friendly way to organize my application. I utilized OptimalSort to conduct my open card sort. Below are the results of the card sort.</p>

                    <h3>Refined Sitemap</h3>
                    <p>Based on the results of the open card sort I made the following changes:</p>

                    <h2>THE DESIGN & PROTOTYPE</h2>
                    <p>Through this iterative design process, I utilized various frameworks which helped me keep the user at the center of the design and development process. For example, I incorporated the principles of usability heuristics, visual and emotional design, responsive frameworks, and accessibility. In addition, I conducted a Usability Test, A/B Preference Test, and Peer Review to test and validate my design decisions. </p>
